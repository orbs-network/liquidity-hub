# Gemini Code Understanding

## Project Overview

This project is a Solidity-based, reactor-based order system for decentralized exchanges. It allows users (swappers) to create and sign orders that are then executed by off-chain executors. The system is designed to be flexible and extensible, with a modular architecture that separates the core logic (reactor) from the execution logic (executors).

The main components of the system are:

*   **Reactor:** The core of the system, responsible for validating and resolving orders. The main reactor contract is `OrderReactor.sol`.
*   **Executors:** Off-chain services that find liquidity and submit transactions to the reactor. The project includes two executor contracts, `Executor.sol` and `LiquidityHub.sol`, which can be used as a reference for building off-chain executors.
*   **RePermit:** A contract that allows users to grant permission to the reactor to transfer their tokens without having to send a separate approval transaction.
*   **Admin:** A contract that manages access control for the executors.

## Building and Running

This is a Foundry project. The following commands can be used to build and test the project:

*   **Build:** `forge build`
*   **Test:** `forge test`

## Development Conventions

The project follows the standard Solidity development conventions. The contracts are well-documented and use the latest version of the Solidity compiler. The project also uses several libraries from OpenZeppelin and UniswapX.
